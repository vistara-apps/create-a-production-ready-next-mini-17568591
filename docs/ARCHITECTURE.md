# Architecture Documentation for miniapp-prod-verify-2

## Application Architecture

### Overview
miniapp-prod-verify-2 follows a modern React application architecture using Next.js as the framework. The application is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable with a clear separation of concerns.

### Component Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture with the following principles:

1. **Atomic Design Methodology**
   - Atoms: Basic UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
   - Molecules: Combinations of atoms (Form fields, Card items)
   - Organisms: Complex UI sections (Forms, Panels)
   - Templates: Page layouts
   - Pages: Complete screens

2. **Component Composition**
   Components are designed to be composable, allowing for flexible UI construction and reuse.

3. **Container/Presentation Pattern**
   - Container components: Handle state and logic
   - Presentation components: Focus on rendering UI

### State Management
The application uses a combination of state management approaches:

1. **Local Component State**
   - Used for UI-specific state that doesn't need to be shared

2. **React Context**
   - Used for global state that needs to be accessed by multiple components
   - Implemented through provider components

3. **React Query**
   - Used for server state management
   - Handles caching, background updates, and optimistic updates

4. **Custom Hooks**
   - Encapsulate and reuse stateful logic
   - Provide a clean API for components

### Data Flow
The application follows a unidirectional data flow:

1. User interactions trigger events
2. Events are handled by event handlers
3. Event handlers update state
4. State changes trigger re-renders
5. UI reflects the new state

### Blockchain Integration
The application integrates with blockchain through:

1. **OnchainKit Provider**
   - Provides blockchain context to the application
   - Manages wallet connection and state

2. **Wagmi Hooks**
   - Used for blockchain interactions
   - Handles contract calls and transactions

3. **Custom Blockchain Utilities**
   - Abstracts complex blockchain operations
   - Provides a clean API for components

### Farcaster Frame Integration
The application integrates with Farcaster frames through:

1. **MiniKit Provider**
   - Provides frame context to the application
   - Manages frame state and navigation

2. **Frame Utilities**
   - Handles frame-specific operations
   - Manages frame state and user interactions

## Technical Decisions

### Next.js
Next.js was chosen for its:
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Built-in routing
- API routes
- TypeScript support
- Performance optimizations

### TypeScript
TypeScript provides:
- Type safety
- Better developer experience
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS was chosen for:
- Utility-first approach
- Consistency in design
- Performance benefits
- Responsive design capabilities

### OnchainKit and MiniKit
These libraries provide:
- Simplified blockchain integration
- Wallet connection management
- Frame integration
- Consistent API for blockchain operations

## Performance Considerations

### Code Splitting
- Pages and components are code-split by default
- Dynamic imports for large components

### Caching Strategy
- React Query for data caching
- SWR patterns for stale-while-revalidate
- Local storage for persistent data

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Minification and compression
- Image optimization

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated
- Sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

### Authentication
- Secure wallet connection
- Session management
- Protected routes

### Environment Variables
- Sensitive information stored in environment variables
- Client-side variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Testing individual functions and utilities
- Isolated component testing

### Integration Testing
- Testing component interactions
- Testing hooks with components

### End-to-End Testing
- Testing complete user flows
- Simulating user interactions

## Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Automated deployment on merge to main

### Environment Configuration
- Environment-specific variables
- Feature flags for controlled rollouts

### Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
