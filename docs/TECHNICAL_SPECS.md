# Technical Specifications for miniapp-prod-verify-2

## Overview
miniapp-prod-verify-2 is a production-ready Next.js Base mini app that integrates with OnchainKit and MiniKit to provide a seamless blockchain experience within the Farcaster ecosystem. The application serves as a template for building decentralized applications that leverage the Base blockchain and Farcaster frames.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain Integration**: OnchainKit, Viem, Wagmi
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Farcaster Integration**: MiniKit

### Component Architecture
The application follows a modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Components**
   - `Providers`: Manages global state and context providers
   - `Layout`: Defines the application layout structure
   - `Page`: Main entry point for the application

2. **UI Components**
   - `Button`: Reusable button component with various styles
   - `Card`: Container component for content grouping
   - `Input`: Form input components
   - `ConnectWalletButton`: Custom wallet connection component

3. **Hooks**
   - `useAuth`: Authentication state management
   - `useBlockchain`: Blockchain interaction utilities
   - `useFrame`: Farcaster frame interaction utilities

4. **Libraries**
   - `auth.ts`: Authentication utilities
   - `blockchain.ts`: Blockchain interaction utilities
   - `logger.ts`: Logging utilities
   - `errorReporting.ts`: Error reporting utilities

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger UI component events
2. Events are handled by custom hooks
3. Hooks interact with library functions for business logic
4. Library functions interact with external services (blockchain, authentication)
5. State updates are propagated back through hooks to UI components

## Performance Considerations
- Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Caching strategies for blockchain data
- Optimized asset loading
- Server-side rendering where appropriate

## Security Considerations
- Secure wallet connection flow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Environment variable management
- Proper authentication and authorization

## Integration Points

### OnchainKit Integration
- Wallet connection and management
- Blockchain transaction handling
- Chain-specific configuration

### MiniKit Integration
- Frame readiness signaling
- Frame state management
- Frame navigation

## Environment Configuration
The application requires the following environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY`: API key for OnchainKit services
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Public URL of the application

## Deployment Strategy
The application is designed to be deployed on Vercel with the following considerations:
- Environment variable configuration
- Build optimization
- Edge caching
- Analytics integration

## Monitoring and Logging
- Client-side error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Blockchain interaction logging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complex flows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
